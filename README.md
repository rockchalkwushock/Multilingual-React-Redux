# Multilingual-React-Redux
A collection of resources I have found for creating Multilingual Web Apps using React &amp; Redux.

## Purpose
I forget stuff a lot! 

However I am creating this as a resource for anyone else that thinks to themselves:

* __"Damn this needs to be in more than one language...how in the hell do I do that?"__
* __"Can I do that with React & Redux?"__
* __"How do I do that with React & Redux?"__


I myself am going to go with the concept of using a HOC just seems cleaner but below are many differing approaches.
All resources are for implementing internationalization/localization in React + Redux web applications Please feel free to add to this resource, I'm making it for everybody to use!!!

**Happy Coding!!!**
